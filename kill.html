        The Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) was established 
        by the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) in 1973 to enable students of tertiary 
        institution have technical knowledge of industrial work base on their course of 
        study before the completion of their program in their respective institutions. 
        The major benefit accruing to students who participate conscientiously in Students 
        Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) are the skills and competencies they acquire. 
        The relevant production skills remain a part of the recipients of industrial training as 
        life-long assets which cannot be taken away from them. This is because the knowledge and 
        skills acquired through training are internalized and become relevant when required to 
        perform jobs or functions.

        SIWES in Nigeria is organized and coordinated by the Industrial 
        Training Fund (ITF) for a period of Three (3) months to One year, 
        depending on the Institution or Faculty involved. ITFâ€™s mandate 
        is to promote and encourage the acquisition of skills in Commerce 
        and Industry with the view of generating numerously trained man power, 
        which will gather basic practical knowledge needed in the industrial 
        world out there. SIWES is a compulsory programme which all national 
        diploma students must undergo as part of the requirements for the award of the NATIONAL DIPLOMA of the college.
